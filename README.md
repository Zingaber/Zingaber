## 👋 Hello, I'm JV Thomas

Welcome to my GitHub.

I work at the intersection of **technology, equity, and impact** — building data tools and AI systems that help communities thrive. I am a **data visualization specialist** and **spatial analytics enthusiast** focused on transforming complex datasets into compelling 3D stories that reveal hidden patterns and drive informed decision-making.

From **3D geospatial visualizations** to open-source projects on climate and public health, I focus on turning complex information into insight and action.

> *I believe technology should serve people — and that intelligence, when guided by conscience, can build a more just and resilient world.*

  Transform raw spatial datasets into culturally sensitive, accurate visualizations that respect local knowledge while maintaining scientific rigor and geographic precision.

- 🎓 **Capacity Building Through Code**  
  Build educational platforms, documentation, and tutorials that teach advanced spatial analysis techniques to emerging data scientists, especially in underserved regions.

- 📊 **Ethical Data Storytelling for Impact**  
  Ensure visualizations accurately represent communities while promoting data literacy, avoiding algorithmic bias, and centering human dignity in every technical decision.

- 🌍 **Scalable Solutions for Global Challenges**  
  Design visualization frameworks that can be adapted across cultures, languages, and technical environments to address local challenges while contributing to global knowledge.
